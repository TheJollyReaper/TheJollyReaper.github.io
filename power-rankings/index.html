<div id="the-one-inch-wonder-1" class="section level1">
<h1>#12: The One Inch Wonder <span style="color: red;"> ↑ 1</span></h1>
<p>Wonder swaps spots with Cunt and returns to the bottom. The continued absence and unreliability of Michael Thomas continues to hit this team bad. It may be time for Wonder to cut their losses and dump him.</p>
</div>
<div id="legarrette-cunt-1" class="section level1">
<h1>#11: LeGarrette Cunt <span style="color: green;"> ↓ 1</span></h1>
<p>Cunt gets their first win in a shocking blowout against Striegel. Perhaps this is a sign that they should start two Ram RBs every week.</p>
</div>
<div id="macho-mel" class="section level1">
<h1>#10: Macho Mel <span style="color: aqua;"> ═</span></h1>
<p>Mel’s season is in jeopardy. The team keeps piling up loss after loss with no end in sight. If they had just started Clay Chasepool like any reasonable team would have done, Mel would have won and stayed alive in the division race. Now they’re 2-3, with a roster that is only going to get worst. Clyde only has one week left of being a starting RB before he loses his job to Bell.</p>
</div>
<div id="team-striegel" class="section level1">
<h1>#9: Team Striegel <span style="color: aqua;"> ═</span></h1>
<p>Of all teams that could have ended Cunt’s winless streak, it had to be Striegel. They do get a bit of a pass though for having 5 players on bye and an injured Nick Chubb. Striegel really should have managed the roster better though to avoid that situation.</p>
</div>
<div id="automoney-draftmongol-1" class="section level1">
<h1>#8: Automoney Draftmongol<span style="color: red;">↑ 1</span></h1>
<p>Lockette continues his cold streak and it clear now that Metcalf is the clear #1 receiver on the Seahawks offense. Similarly, despite getting a large TD DJ Moore is still getting a worryingly low number of targets compared to #1 receiver Robby Anderson. To pile on even more, Mostert did not look nearly as good as McKinnon in an awful showing by the 49ers. Taking into consideration the brutal schedule coming up for Santa Clara, Mostert is a very minor upgrade over David Johnson. The decision to trade away Mostert for CMC is looking really bad right now.</p>
</div>
<div id="malik-turners-playoff-catch-1" class="section level1">
<h1>#7: Malik Turner’s Playoff Catch % <span style="color: green;"> ↓ 1</span></h1>
<p>Malik Turner gets another win and stays alive in the division race. Watson is gradually starting to look somewhat decent, and the death of Bill O’Brien greatly improves his long-term potential this season. Chark did get injured (again), and Kittle (along with all other 49er’s) likely shouldn’t be trusted too much the rest of the season.</p>
</div>
<div id="sarah-please-take-me-back" class="section level1">
<h1>#6: Sarah Please Take Me Back <span style="color: aqua;"> ═ </span></h1>
<p>You know a team is unspectacular when the ranking committee completely forgets they exist. Despite beating Wonder, Sarah Please Take Me Back is barely treading water. An up-and-down season for Juju, lack of scoring outside Jacobs and Conner, and an awful bench are holding this team back from being decent.</p>
</div>
<div id="belchers-pistol-offense-1" class="section level1">
<h1>#5: Belchers Pistol Offense<span style="color: red;"> ↑ 1</span></h1>
<p>Belcher may have won the match, but at the same time their season is over. Dead. The moment Prescott went down Belchers season went down the drain. It could have been salvageable, but Belchers Pistol Offense decided to replace him with Kirk Cousins of all people. Andy “Red Rifle” was still available.</p>
</div>
<div id="no-kap-1" class="section level1">
<h1>#4: No Kap<span style="color: red;">↑ 1</span></h1>
<p>Rough day for Kap. From potentially being division leader to being two games down. No Kap is quickly losing steam and could be in for another rough week.</p>
</div>
<div id="team-hide-and-zeke-2" class="section level1">
<h1>#3: Team Hide and Zeke <span style="color: green;"> ↓ 2</span></h1>
<p>Hide and Zeke is now on a 3 game winning streak! The arrival of Mike Davis drastically changed the fortunes of this time. Time is clicking though to find a replacement. As they are now, Hide and Zeke is going to drop off a cliff the moment CMC returns.</p>
</div>
<div id="gelato-47" class="section level1">
<h1>#2: Gelato #47 <span style="color: aqua;"> ═</span></h1>
<p>Gelato had a bit of a slow game with the absence of Aaron Jones, but they still took care of business to get to 5-0. At this point there’s no reason to believe Gelato won’t easily take the division.</p>
</div>
<div id="hobolopolis-hyperhobos" class="section level1">
<h1>#1: Hobolopolis Hyperhobos <span style="color: aqua;"> ═</span></h1>
<p>The Hobo’s took a vacation this week as they continue to rest in preparation for the playoffs. Adam Humphries returns this week, with Sterling Shepard and Christian McCaffery due to arrive not too long from now. John Brown should also (finally) be healthy again. The Hobos at full strength are going to be a nightmare matchup come playoff time.</p>
