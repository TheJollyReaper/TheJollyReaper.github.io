<div id="best-loser" class="section level1">
<h1>#12: Best Loser <span style="color: aqua;"> ═ </span></h1>
<p>Truly the best at losing.</p>
</div>
<div id="team-striegel-1" class="section level1">
<h1>#11: Team Striegel <span style="color: red;"> ↑ 1</span></h1>
<p>The story of Striegel’s season. Even when most of the week goes well, they somehow find a way to lose every single time by the slimmest of margins.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-one-inch-wonder-1" class="section level1">
<h1>#10: The One Inch Wonder <span style="color: green;"> ↓ 1</span></h1>
<p>The One Inch Wonder is technically not dead yet. A surprise upset over the floundering Gelato has kept them in the playoff hunt.</p>
</div>
<div id="part-1-malik-turners-playoff-catch" class="section level1">
<h1>#9 part 1: Malik Turner’s Playoff Catch % <span style="color: aqua;"> ═ </span></h1>
<p>This team had a shot at overcoming a playoff rival and clearing the path to a wildcard, but instead they somehow screwed up and got in a tie.</p>
</div>
<div id="part-2-legarrette-cunt-1" class="section level1">
<h1>#9 part 2: LeGarrette Cunt <span style="color: red;"> ↑ 1</span></h1>
<p>This team had a shot at overcoming a playoff rival and clearing the path to a wildcard, but instead they somehow screwed up and got in a tie.</p>
</div>
<div id="belchers-pistol-offense-2" class="section level1">
<h1>#7: Belchers Pistol Offense <span style="color: red;"> ↑ 2</span></h1>
<p>The Hobo’s debuting CMC and Herbear almost outscored Belchers Pistol Offense by themselves. The Patriots defense again disappointed with only a measly 3 points.</p>
</div>
<div id="macho-mel-2" class="section level1">
<h1>#6: Macho Mel <span style="color: green;"> ↓ 2</span></h1>
<p>After what was probably the worst start in franchise history, Macho Mel is now 5-4 and in control of the #4 playoff seed. One must wonder when the luck will end though. If Justin Jackson had managed to run even 3-4 plays before injuring himself, Mel’s party train would have ended this past week.</p>
</div>
<div id="sarah-please-take-me-back-1" class="section level1">
<h1>#5: Sarah Please Take Me Back <span style="color: green;"> ↓ 1</span></h1>
<p>Sarah Please Take Me Back was firing on all cylinders; their bench alone outscored two other starting lineups in the league. We don’t see this being sustainable.</p>
</div>
<div id="team-hide-and-zeke" class="section level1">
<h1>#4: Team Hide and Zeke <span style="color: aqua;"> ═ </span></h1>
<p>Team Hide and Zeke was awful. Their 83 points would have beaten only two teams last week, one of them luckily for them being their opponent. Hide and Zeke is receiving another Mike Davis rental for a few weeks which is going to be a massive boost as we near the end of the playoff race.</p>
</div>
<div id="gelato-46" class="section level1">
<h1>#3: Gelato #46 <span style="color: aqua;"> ═ </span></h1>
<p>Gelato is doing everything possible to give away the division title, but no one is willing to capitalize.</p>
</div>
<div id="no-kap" class="section level1">
<h1>#2: No Kap <span style="color: aqua;"> ═ </span></h1>
<p>Maybe the weakest #2 seed of all time. This team is Dalvin Cook. Even if he scores 30+ every week there’s no guarantee No Kap will win due to how weak the rest of the roster is.</p>
</div>
<div id="hobolopolis-hyperhobos" class="section level1">
<h1>#1: Hobolopolis Hyperhobos <span style="color: aqua;"> ═ </span></h1>
<p>The debuting Hobos CMC and Herbear combined for a dominant 54 points. The Hobos are looking strong and at this point appear to be the only team with a playoff spot firmly in control.</p>
