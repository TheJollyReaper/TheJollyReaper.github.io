<div id="team-striegel-3" class="section level2">
<h2>#12: Team Striegel <span style="color: red;"> ↑ 3<span></h2>
<p>Justin Tucker deserves better.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-one-inch-wonder-1" class="section level1">
<h1>#11: The One Inch Wonder <span style="color: green;"> ↓ 1 </span></h1>
<p>Despite several awful performances in the starting lineup, The One Inch Wonder pulled off a dominant victory over Striegel. Not everything looks good for Wonder though; Michael Thomas is once again hurt and will likely miss even more time.</p>
</div>
<div id="best-loser-previously-known-as-automongol-cocker-spaniel-2" class="section level1">
<h1>#10: Best Loser (previously known as Automongol Cocker Spaniel) <span style="color: red;"> ↑ 2 </span></h1>
<p>It has not been a good week for Best Loser, once known as Moneycock Autoloser. Best Loser, who is known for losing, lost big time in a big way this week. Losers around the world marveled at the sheer magnitude of how much Best Loser lost this week. Not only did Best Loser lose by 20+ points and increase their losing streak to 3 games, Best Loser also lost Raheem Mostert, the main acquisition in their deal with the Hobos a few weeks ago. Loser is expected to lose Mostert for about a month, 4-6 games is likely. Maybe Best Loser could make a deal to get McKinnon in the meantime, who is now with Striegel.</p>
</div>
<div id="macho-mel-1" class="section level1">
<h1>#9: Macho Mel <span style="color: green;"> ↓ 1 </span></h1>
<p>Mel had their best game of the season to knock off previously undefeated Gelato #66. What once looked like one of the worst WR groups in the league is suddenly filled with depth. Julio is back and looking healthy, Brandin Cooks got revived after the sacrifice of Bill O’Brien, Higgins looks better every week, and Claypool continues to look like what Juju should have been. Despite the newfound receiver success, the RB group is in rough condition. Sanders already missed Thursday’s game against the Giants and could potentially miss week 8 as well. RoJo has completely taken the Bucs RB1 job leaving nothing for Fournette, and even Clyde will likely start losing carries to Bell. Mel needs to find some running back help.</p>
</div>
<div id="sarah-please-take-bad-juju-away-2" class="section level1">
<h1>#8: Sarah Please Take Bad Juju Away<span style="color: red;"> ↑ 2 </span></h1>
<p>Awful week for Sarah Please Take Me Back. Juju had another horrible outing with an awful 1-point game. Tyreek Hill joined the let down party and put up 3.5 points. A more reasonable team would be willing to cut their losses with Juju and accept Randall “Corn Jokes” Cobb, but the dysfunction permeating this team at every level leads to very questionable roster decisions.</p>
</div>
<div id="legarrette-cunt-4" class="section level1">
<h1>#7: LeGarrette Cunt <span style="color: green;"> ↓ 4</span></h1>
<p>Cunt got off to a dreadful 0-4 start this season, but has quietly racked up 2 wins in a row. The RB group continues to be in dire straits. The Damien Harris hype train has come to a screeching halt, and Ekeler will continue to be absent for a while. On a positive note, Boston Scott is a good rental for the week or two Sanders is out.</p>
</div>
<div id="malik-turners-playoff-catch-1" class="section level1">
<h1>#6: Malik Turner’s Playoff Catch % <span style="color: green;"> ↓ 1</span></h1>
<p>3 wins in a row now for Malik Turner. Golladay, Parker, and Crowder may not sound like the most impressive group of receivers, but it’s getting the job done for Catch %. Kenyan Drake and Watson also had massive games this past week. If they continue to perform at this level, Malik Turner has a good shot at sneaking into the playoffs in a wildcard spot.</p>
</div>
<div id="no-kap-1" class="section level1">
<h1>#5: No Kap <span style="color: red;"> ↑ 1</span></h1>
<p>At one point in the season No Kap looked like one of the strongest teams in the league, but now they are falling apart completely. The injuries to Gordon and Cook have been too much for Kap to overcome, and now Joe Mixon is dealing with an injury. No Kap needs to get back to full strength fast before they get into too big of a hole to come back from.</p>
</div>
<div id="team-hide-and-zeke-1" class="section level1">
<h1>#4: Team Hide and Zeke <span style="color: red;"> ↑ 1</span></h1>
<p>What an impressive combination of failure for Hide and Zeke. Both Elliot and Mike Davis completely failed to show up while Metcalf sat on the bench. It is clear Hide and Zeke needs all three to constantly perform at a high level to get wins. There is still no replacement for Mike Davis on the roster, who at the most has two games left as a relevant fantasy starter.</p>
</div>
<div id="belchers-pistol-offense-2" class="section level1">
<h1>#3: Belchers Pistol Offense <span style="color: green;"> ↓ 2</span></h1>
<p>After listening to our advice, Belchers Pistol Offense picked up Kirk Cousins who then led them to a blowout victory over Hide and Zeke. With 4 wins in a row, Belchers Pistol Offense is looking like the hottest team in the league at the moment. There has to be some concern growing though; with the Bucs signing of Mr. Big Chest, Godwin’s production will inevitably go down. Given the lack of receiver production on the roster, any decrease in Godwin’s output will be tough to handle.</p>
</div>
<div id="gelato-46" class="section level1">
<h1>#2: Gelato #46 <span style="color: aqua;"> ═ </span></h1>
<p>Surprisingly it wasn’t the absence of Russell Wilson that handed Gelato their first loss; it was the absence of literally everyone not named Tannehill, Koo, or the Steelers defense. Gelato is also dealing with injuries to Aaron Jones and Hopkins, both of which could be out this week. Due to Gelato’s tiebreaking victories over both Belcher and No Kap, Gelato can afford to drop a game or two due to injury.</p>
</div>
<div id="hobolopolis-hyperhobos" class="section level1">
<h1>#1: Hobolopolis Hyperhobos <span style="color: aqua;"> ═ </span></h1>
<p>The Hobos have moved on from their first 7 picks in the draft (and their 8th round pick is on the chopping block). They have dealt with massive injuries all season. Despite that, the Hobos are 5-1 with a dominant 2 game lead in the division. And despite being tied for the best record in the league, there is no team with greater potential for improvement than the Hobos. Fulgham is proving to be the reincarnation of Jerry Rice. Sterling Shepard had a great first game back. Antonio Brown and McCaffery will likely be active week 9. Even the acquisition of the Ravens defense will have huge ramifications in the playoffs, due to their schedule against the Dalton Cowboys, Browns, Jags, and Giants in weeks 13-16. The Hobos are going to peak at the perfect time.</p>
