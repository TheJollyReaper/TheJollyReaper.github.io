<div id="best-loser-3" class="section level1">
<h1>#12: Best Loser <span style="color: red;"> ↑ 3</span></h1>
<p>Rough week for Best Loser. Chris Carson was ruled out in a game time decision, and then literally everyone not named Rodgers or Kupp were awful. The Browns offense was completely shutdown leading to a slow day in the office for Kareem Hunt. Tyler Lockett took a backseat to Metcalf. DJ Moore never showed up to his game, and Scotty Miller never fails to disappoint expectations when placed in the starting lineup. With Carson out for at least another week, Best Loser is not in a good position.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-one-inch-wonder" class="section level1">
<h1>#11: The One Inch Wonder <span style="color: aqua;"> ═ </span></h1>
<p>Half of The One Inch Wonder’s points came from Chiefs. Michael Thomas is probably back this week which should be a big boost, but RB is still a massive issue for Inch. Le’Veon Bell has not performed to the level the team hoped.</p>
</div>
<div id="team-striegel-2" class="section level1">
<h1>#10: Team Striegel <span style="color: green;"> ↓ 2</span></h1>
<p>Davante Adams is averaging 30.7 points in his last 3 games. While it’s likely too late to salvage the season, Striegel should be a very strong team once Chubb returns. Striegel is poised to take several teams down with them and ruin potential playoff runs.</p>
</div>
<div id="malik-turners-playoff-catch-1" class="section level1">
<h1>#9: Malik Turner’s Playoff Catch % <span style="color: red;"> ↑ 1</span></h1>
<p>Catch % pulled a Cowboys and failed forwards into a playoff spot despite losing their 2nd straight game. The loss of George Kittle absolutely cripples this team. Jordan Reed this past Thursday was only targeted twice as the 49ers offense was completely shutdown for the majority of their game against Green Bay. The loss of Kittle, Drake, and even Freeman is going to tank this teams playoff chances.</p>
</div>
<div id="macho-mel-2" class="section level1">
<h1>#8: Macho Mel <span style="color: green;"> ↓ 2</span></h1>
<p>Macho Mel has silently been picking up wins and has clawed their way to a 4-4 record, but the roster is still very unsteady. Clyde continues to fail to live up to his first round draft position, Jonathan Taylor had a very rough game last week and is in danger of losing snaps, and there is no reliable starting quarterback on the roster. On a positive note, it looks like Leonard Fournette has taken over the Bucs starting job, giving Mel a reliable RB2 going forward the rest of the season.</p>
</div>
<div id="sarah-please" class="section level1">
<h1>#7: Sarah Please <span style="color: aqua;"> ═ </span></h1>
<p>Sarah Please Take Me Back is about as average and uninspiring as a team can get.</p>
</div>
<div id="legarrette-cunt" class="section level1">
<h1>#6: LeGarrette Cunt <span style="color: aqua;"> ═ </span></h1>
<p>Winning is not the only thing that matters in fantasy. Your team’s performance and future potential plays a big part in power rankings. And when it comes to future potential, Cunt has none. La’Mical Perine is by far the best running back on this team. Evwin was a one week rental, Scott is irrelevant with Sanders coming back, Brown and Henderson are both awful, and Wilkins was a one week wonder. Cunt is going to have to rely on Murray to continue to have massive games, and Cunt is going to need Godwin to return soon. Godwin’s production with AB in the lineup is going to have massive ramifications for how Cunt’s season ends.</p>
</div>
<div id="belchers-pistol-offense-1" class="section level1">
<h1>#5: Belchers Pistol Offense <span style="color: red;"> ↑ 1</span></h1>
<p>Once again Belcher’s Pistol Offense started the Patriots defense, and once again, they lost. Belcher’s Pistol Offense is a mediocre 2-4 with the Patriots defense in the starting lineup, and a perfect 2-0 with the Patriots on the bench.</p>
</div>
<div id="team-hide-and-zeke-1" class="section level1">
<h1>#4: Team Hide and Zeke <span style="color: red;"> ↑ 1</span></h1>
<p>Hide and Zeke’s last week of Mike Davis did not go well. Hide and Zeke completely wasted a monster 34 point game from DK Metcalf. There is just no hope for this team without a strong RB1. Hide and Zeke made a questionable decision to trade for Ronald Jones right before his game last week, where he clearly lost his starting job. With Elliot and Jackson failing to live up to expectations and Mike Evans tendency to completely disappear, this might be Hide and Zeke’s last week before joining the ranks of Striegel and The One Inch Wonder.</p>
</div>
<div id="gelato-46-2" class="section level1">
<h1>#3: Gelato #46 <span style="color: green;"> ↓ 2</span></h1>
<p>Despite leaving two inactive players in the lineup, Gelato got things back on track with a dominant victory over Sarah Please Take Me Back. There is still a lot of room for concern on this team though. Injuries have decimated Gelato and suddenly their division lead looks very shaky.</p>
</div>
<div id="no-kap" class="section level1">
<h1>#2: No Kap <span style="color: aqua;"> ═ </span></h1>
<p>Dalvin Cook is not scoring 47 points again this season; maybe ever. And that’s a concern for No Kap, because outside Cook and Corey Davis, there is nothing positive to speak about.</p>
</div>
<div id="hobolopolis-hyperhobos" class="section level1">
<h1>#1: Hobolopolis Hyperhobos <span style="color: aqua;"> ═ </span></h1>
<p>Winning is the only thing that matters in fantasy and with a 6-2 record, the Hobos have done a whole lot of winning. With new addition Dez Bryant, the Hobos playoff roster is finally assembled.</p>
