<div id="legarrette-cunt-1" class="section level1">
<h1>#12: LeGarrette Cunt <span style="color: red;">‚Üë 1</span></h1>
<p>Cunt may be winless, and they may have just put up the season‚Äôs lowest score of the week, and Ekeler may be out for the foreseeable future, but that doesn‚Äôt mean LeGarrette Cunt has to lose hope! Any day know Gronk may find a time machine and become ten years younger! And who knows, maybe Sammy Watkins will finally have his breakout season! Cunt needs to stay positive and believe that they can win at least one game this season.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-one-inch-wonder-1" class="section level1">
<h1>#11: The One Inch Wonder <span style="color: green;">‚Üì 1</span></h1>
<p>The One Inch Wonder tried really, really hard so we have to move them up one spot. There were lots of players on this team with ouchies that couldn‚Äôt compete last week, but everyone can rejoice because Thomas, Bell, and Johnson are all coming back this week!! üòä<br>
The One Inch Wonder is truly a team in Ray Rice‚Äôs Left Hook and has a chance of not losing going forward.</p>
</div>
<div id="macho-mel-2" class="section level1">
<h1>#10: Macho Mel <span style="color: red;">‚Üë 2 </span></h1>
<p>Silly Macho Mel forgot there was a game last week and failed to show up. That‚Äôs OK though! Once Sanders, Taylor and Woods set their alarm clocks and wake up on time, we‚Äôre positive they‚Äôll have a big impact on games!</p>
</div>
<div id="team-striegel-3" class="section level1">
<h1>#9: Team Striegel <span style="color: red;">‚Üë 3 </span></h1>
<p>Striegel was awful and fell to a laughably bad 1-3 record.</p>
</div>
<div id="malik-turners-playoff-catch-2" class="section level1">
<h1>#8: Malik Turner‚Äôs Playoff Catch % <span style="color: green;">‚Üì 2</span></h1>
<p>Malik Turner had an awesome game! Poor lil Kenyan Drake had a bit of a rough game, but through the power of friendship and teamwork everyone came together to beat the complete shit out of The One Inch Wonder, what a garbage team that is to have a fun competitive match with The One Inch Wonder and come away with a big victory! If they keep this up, they‚Äôll surely be an amazing team this year!</p>
</div>
<div id="automongol-moneydraft-4" class="section level1">
<h1>#7: Automongol Moneydraft <span style="color: red;">‚Üë 4 </span></h1>
<p>Mongol did a very bad thing this week ‚òπ<br>
Their best player had a very big ouchie and hasn‚Äôt been able to play for a while. Instead of giving him love and support, Automeanie decided they didn‚Äôt want him anymore and gave him away. Meanie‚Äôs never prosper! Mongoldraft is going to be sad when McCaffery puts up 50 points a game with the Happy Hobos.</p>
</div>
<div id="sarah-please-take-me-back-1" class="section level1">
<h1>#6: Sarah Please Take Me Back<span style="color: red;">‚Üë 1 </span></h1>
<p>Everyone has bad days! A 1-3 record isn‚Äôt bad at all, winning a single game is something Sarah Please Take Me Back can be very proud about! One of these days Sarah will put everything together and go on a big winning streak!</p>
</div>
<div id="team-hide-and-zeke-4" class="section level1">
<h1>#5: Team Hide and Zeke <span style="color: green;">‚Üì 4</span></h1>
<p>Despite an uncharacteristically poor game from Lamar Jackson, Team Hide and Zeke managed to narrowly come out with their first win of the season behind Mike Evans legendary 2 yard, 2 touchdown game.</p>
</div>
<div id="belchers-pistol-offense-3" class="section level1">
<h1>#4: Belchers Pistol Offense <span style="color: green;">‚Üì 3</span></h1>
<p>It is always hard to let go of someone you love. This week, Belchers Pistol Offense finally let go of an abusive relationship and allowed the Pats D to sit on the bench and was rewarded with a huge victory. We know this must be a tough time for Belchers Pistol Offense. Belcher and the Pats big D had so much fun together last year, but they just couldn‚Äôt connect this year. All good things must come to an end, and now is the time to be proud of Belchers Pistol Offense and support them as they transition to a new starting D.</p>
</div>
<div id="no-kap-1" class="section level1">
<h1>#3: No Kap <span style="color: green;">‚Üì 1</span></h1>
<p>Wow! No Kap was amazing! Five players had more than twenty points! This is such a fun and happy team, no wonder they keep winning! Tom Brady never looked younger, and it was good to see Joe Mixon stop being a complete disappointment play at his best after having such a hard time to begin the season.</p>
</div>
<div id="gelato-44" class="section level1">
<h1>#2: Gelato #44 <span style="color: aqua;">‚ïê</span></h1>
<p>What a shit team. Gelato was stupidly lucky to win with only a pathetic 113.5 points. Fake #1 seed. They‚Äôre only undefeated because of a cupcake schedule, but like the Patriots defense last year, Gelato is going to collapse once they face REAL teams. Gallup continues to be awful this year, still no TE worth a damn on this team, and the Cardinals hot streak has come to an end, dooming Hopkins production for the rest of the season.</p>
</div>
<div id="hobolopolis-hyperhobos" class="section level1">
<h1>#1: Hobolopolis Hyperhobos <span style="color: aqua;">‚ïê</span></h1>
<p>The grit and determination the Hobos displayed was truly awe inspiring, as they marched to a 4-0 record and a dominant 2 game lead over the rest of the Try Hard division. New Hobo Christian McCaffery will form an unstoppable pairing with James Robinson and there will be no stopping this team.</p>
