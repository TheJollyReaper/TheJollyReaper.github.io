# #12: Best Loser <span style="color: aqua;"> ═ </span>
Still the best at losing. 

# #11: Team Striegel <span style="color: red;"> ↑ 1</span>
Josh Reynolds failed Striegel.

# #10: The One Inch Wonder <span style="color: green;"> ↓ 1</span>
The One Inch Wonder had the league’s top score of the week with a dominant victory over Best Loser. Too little too late, but at least Inch can head to the consolation tournament on a high note.

# #9: Macho Mel <span style="color: red;"> ↑ 1</span>
Mel’s tumultuous season came to a fitting end this week in a razor thin loss to Belcher’s Pistol Offense. So much went wrong for Mel. Joe Burrow died in the fourth quarter, Miles Sanders had his most disappointing game of the season, and the lineup decisions were overall a complete disaster. 70 points left on the bench; a number of Mel’s benched players would have given them the victory.  

# #8: Belchers Pistol Offense <span style="color: green;"> ↓ 1</span>
Belchers Pistol Offense ruined Mel’s playoffs dreams this past week despite -1 points from the Patriots defense. Ekeler’s return gives this team a much needed boost for consolation play, but the roster is still too weak to be much of a threat. 

# #7: LeCunt Malik Turner <span style="color: aqua;"> ═ </span>
There is zero reason to continue separating LeGarrette Cunt and Catch % in the rankings. Ever since the tie they have been cursed to perform identically. They both had a critical must win game this past week, and they both lost. Both teams are still alive but only by the slimmest of margins. 

# #5: Team Hide and Zeke <span style="color: aqua;"> ═ </span>
RoJo was back! And then he wasn’t. Despite the running back troubles, Taysom’s one week rental at TE has given Hide and Zeke control of their playoff schedule. 

# #4: Sarah Please Take Me Back <span style="color: aqua;"> ═ </span>
Sarah Please Take Me Back is on the quietest 3 game winning streak ever. JuJu’s sporadic production is worrying, but Sarah’s roster has grown to be very solid and a realistic threat to anyone they face in the postseason. 

# #3: Gelato #46 <span style="color: aqua;"> ═ </span>
Gelato cemented their position as the #1 seed but lost of their two rostered running backs in the process. It’s very, very questionable roster management to have zero running back depth. If Gurley is out for more than this week, it can turn out to be catastrophic for Gelato.

# #2: No Kap <span style="color: aqua;"> ═ </span>
A very solid outing by No Kap at every level.

# #1: Hobolopolis Hyperhobos <span style="color: aqua;"> ═ </span>
A solid week overall for the Hobos. Key started Hurst and Fulgham are getting their bad games out of the way before the playoffs start, and new started Antonio Brown is gradually increasing his production every week. Despite a league-imposed handicap during the first week of the playoffs, the Hobo’s are in a good spot.
