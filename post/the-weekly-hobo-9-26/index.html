<em>And his name is Mike Gesicki</em>
</center>
<p>If someone were to ask you who the number one tight end in fantasy was, what would you say? Travis Kelce? George Kittle? The ghost of Rob Gronkowski? If your response would be any of those, you would be incorrect. Horribly incorrect. As of this very moment the #1 tight end according to total fantasy points is none other than Mike “The God” Gesicki. No one believed in Gesicki, except the Hobos. The Hyperhobos knew he would be something special and when he fell all the way down to the 12th round in the draft, the Hobos knew they had the steal of the century.
<br><br>
<i>How did Gesicki go under the radar for so long?</i> <br>
Despite being the starting tight end in the prolific Miami Dolphins offense (led by the Hobos starting QB Ryan Fitzmagic), at the start of the season no one believed Gesicki would finally make the jump and become the best tight end in football. Years of suffering under the Gase regime lowered peoples perceptions of him. A star can’t be hidden for long though. Circumstances aligned perfectly this year and allowed him to reach his true potential, and now he’s ready to carry Hobolopolis to a championship.
<br><br>
<i>What does the future hold for Gesicki?</i> <br>
Nothing but touchdowns.
<br><br>
<i>Is Gesicki for sale?</i> <br>
While we know all of Ray Rice’s Left Hook must be seething with rage and jealousy at the Hobo’s for nabbing Gesicki, there is a reason why they confidently kicked Kittle to the curb. Gesicki is here to stay as a Hobo.</p>

<div id="around-the-hobo" class="section level1">
<h1>Around the Hobo:</h1>
<ul>
<li>Macho Mel being investigated for possible ties to the NFL apocalypse which injured dozens of players around the league</li>
<li>Malik Turner’s Playoff Catch % is reportedly spamming the Hyperhobo front office pleading for a refund</li>
<li>Gronk experiment over. Gelato mercilessly cut Gronk from the team after a mere two disappointing weeks. How will the rest of the roster react to such a merciless and unforgiving action? Could this be a sign of future locker room rebellion?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="week-3-predictions" class="section level1">
<h1>Week 3 Predictions</h1>
<p><strong>Hyperhobos vs Sarah Please Take Me Back</strong><br>
The Hobos are off to a blistering hot start led by the bearded God Fitzpatrick and the new Hobo in town, James Robinson. The dominant 58-0 lead in favor of Hobolopolis is too great of a deficit for Sarah to overcome, especially if Josh Jacobs ends up being out or limited on Sunday. The Hobo Hype Train® has 3-0 as its next destination.</p>
<p><strong>The One Inch Wonder vs Macho Mel</strong><br>
Macho Mel hasn’t exactly been “Macho” to begin the season, but there’s no better way to get things going in the right direction than a matchup with The One Inch Wonder. With Bell and Michael Thomas out, The One Inch Wonder has no chance at all.</p>
<p><strong>Malik Turner’s Playoff Catch % vs Team Hide and Zeke</strong><br>
Malik Turner watched their former player put up 27 points for the Hobos in the Thursday night game. Meanwhile, new Playoff Catch %’ers George Kittle and DJ Chark will be sitting on the bench. Garbage Time Commander Watson will be healthy and starting though; we’ll see how he adapts to the new environment. On the other hand, due to their complete ineptitude the first two weeks of the season Team Hide and Zeke won the waiver lottery and now have a powerful flex in Mike Davis. The game should be close, but we like Hide and Zeke’s chances to get their first win of the season.</p>
<p><strong>Team Striegel vs Gelato #41</strong><br>
Despite not having a tight end, Gelato is too much for a weak roster like Toaster Striegel. Expect another blowout victory for Gelato.</p>
<p><strong>Moneyball Cockmonger vs LeGarrette Cunt</strong><br>
Not even the death of Christian McCaffery is going to be much help for LeGarrette Cunt. Jeff Wilson is getting 0 fantasy points this week as the Hobo’s McKinnon will completely dominatee the share of touches. Malcolm Brown cooled off after a fluke week 1 performance and won’t contribute much either. The duo of Chris Carson and Chris Boswell will lead Cockmonger to a huge win.</p>
<p><strong>No Kap vs Belchers Pistol Offense</strong><br>
No Kap’s highly questionable decision to start Shenault Jr. would give a competent team a major advantage. Unfortunately, Belchers Pistol Offense is not a competent team. No Kap should easily move on to 3-0 while Pistol Offense falls to 0-3.</p>
