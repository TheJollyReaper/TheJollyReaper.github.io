<h1>A Brief Playoff Update</h1>
<img src="https://pictureisunrelated.files.wordpress.com/2007/09/the-picture.jpg?w=584" />
<em>gotta go fast</em>
</center>
<p><b> In control of their destiny </b><br></p>
<ul>
<li>Hyperhobos</li>
<li>Gelato</li>
<li>No Kap</li>
</ul>
<p>One more win by the Hobos and they lock up the Try Hard division; along with a playoff spot. Gelato and No Kap don’t have as big of a cushion as the Hobos, but there’s no threat to their playoff security if they win the last two games. <br></p>
<p><b> The realistic wildcards </b><br></p>
<ul>
<li>Malik Turner’s Playoff Catch % - leading</li>
<li>LeGarrette Cunt</li>
<li>Team Hide and Zeke</li>
<li>Sarah Please Take Me Back</li>
<li>Macho Mel</li>
</ul>
<p>Realistically speaking, only 1 team in this group is getting to the playoffs, maybe 2 if No Kap chokes.The tie between Cunt and Catch % really threw a wrench into this playoff race. If they both win their last two games of the season, the playoff spot is likely going to Catch %. The 60 point different between Cunt and % is probably too large to overcome over a two week period. Things get complicated if either (or both) teams lose at least a game. The group behind them (Mel, Sarah, Zeke) likely need two things to happen to get to the playoffs: both Cunt and Catch % need to drop a game, and they need to go 2-0. <br><br>
If Macho Mel and Hide and Zeke tie at 7-5: Mel advances <br>
If Macho Mel and Sarah tie at 7-5: Sarah Advances <br>
If Zeke and Sarah tie at 7-5: Zeke advances <br>
3-way 7-5 tie: Too close to call, Macho Mel currently in the lead via point differential <br><br></p>
<p>Important matchup: Week 11 LeGarrette Cunt vs Hide and Zeke <br>
Loser is most likely out of the playoffs</p>

<div id="around-the-hobo" class="section level1">
<h1>Around the Hobo:</h1>
<ul>
<li>LeGarrette Cunt sends threatening demands to the Hobo News Network headquarters. Commisioner Jose looking into potential repercussions to punish their revolting behavior.</li>
<li>Kalen Ballage taking over as the face of the Charger’s franchise?</li>
<li>Seahawks defense hits the open market</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="week-11-predictions" class="section level1">
<h1>Week 11 Predictions:</h1>
<p><strong>Hyperhobos vs No Kap</strong><br>
The Hobos are being hit hard by byes and injuries this week, but they managed to find suitable fill-ins with Ballage and KJ Hamler. This match may be surprisingly close thanks to Dalvin Cook’s scheduled matchup against paper bags, but the Hobos depth should still be able to get the job done and lead Hobolopolis to another win.</p>
<p><strong>Gelato #41 vs Malik Turner’s Playoff Catch %</strong><br>
Not an amazing start for Gelato. 7.5 points is definitely not what you want from your #1 receiver. With Stefon Diggs on bye, Gelato is looking at another rough week. Malik Turner wins.</p>
<p><strong>Macho Mel vs Belcher’s Pistol Offense</strong><br>
We are calling the upset. A massive game from Carson Wentz is going to give Belcher the victory and knock Mel out of playoff contention.</p>
<p><strong>Team Hide and Zeke vs LeGarrette Cunt</strong><br>
Both teams are fighting for their playoff lives. Whoever losses this is most likely out of the playoffs. <br>
Unfortunately for LeGarrette Cunt, Team Hide and Zeke at least for this week, gets to have a starting quarterback slot in as a TE. This is a stupidly unfair advantage, but props have to be given to Hide and Zeke for being the first to hear the news and pickup Taysom. Unless he gets benched for Winston halfway through the game, Taysom Hill is ending Cunt’s season this week.</p>
<p><strong>Team Striegel vs Sarah Please Take Me Back</strong><br>
Sarah will be the 3rd team to take a crippling blow to their playoff hopes this week; Striegel is going to play spoiler and get a huge upset victory.</p>
<p><strong>The One Inch Wonder vs Best Loser</strong><br>
The only completely meaningless game of the week. Both teams are out of contention. Best Loser wins despite not having a complete lineup.</p>
