*Trades can make or break a season*
</center>

As we near the end of the season, it is time to look back at some of the biggest trades of the season and see which teams came out on top. <br>

<strong>Shipping out the Browns <br></strong>
Macho Mel trades: A.J. Brown, Marquise Brown <br>
LeGarrette Cunt trades: Leonard Fournette, Julio Jones <br>

For a while it looked like Cunt really got away with a steal, but recent events have tipped the needle firmly in Mel's favor. Both Julio Jones and A.J. Brown have been terrific receivers since returning from injuries and are strong #1 options. Where the trade went bad for Cunt is the opposite direction Fournette and Marquise Brown are trending. Marquise has been stuck on an offense where the first, second, and third option is to have the quarterback rush and hope for the best. His production is decent as best and has been relegated to the bench for week 9. On the other hand despite having a rough first half of the season due to injury; Fournette looks poised to take over the starting job on the Bucs offense, setting him up for a very strong 2nd half of the season. <br>
<strong>Winner: Macho Mel </strong> <br><br>

<strong>The Ascension of James RB1nson<br></strong>
Hobolopolis Hyperhobos trade: DJ Chark, George Kittle, Deshaun Watson<br>
Malik Turner's Playoff Catch % trades: James RB1nson, Carson Wentz, Hayden Hurst <br>

There is a <i>lot</i> to unpack from this trade. First a bit of context is needed; a week prior to this trade the Hobos lost #3 draft pick Saquon Barkley for the season. The Hobos felt like they badly needed some running back help (which proved to be true once Mostert also went down to injury). The lackluster start to the season by Chark and Watson, combined with the breakout performance by Gesicki on week 2, made the Hobos feel comfortable making this trade to land new sensation RB1nson. For the most part, the Hobos definitely got the better deal. Stuck in an awful offense, Chark has delivered dud after dud. Chark had insane hype this past offseason, and it's safe to say he has spectacularly failed to match expectations. Watson has actually managed to bounce back into a solid weekly starter. He has definitely been a bright spot for Catch %. Kittle. Kittle came back from injury, had 2 good games, 2 mediocre games, and then he got injured again. Kittle was dropped and now he's back with the Hobos. It's possible he's out for the season, but there is a chance that Kittle will be back during the championship with a very tasty matchup against Seattle. <br> <br>
The Hobos recieved several solid QB1 weeks from Carson Wentz, a consistent, decent TE floor in Hayden Hurst, and a top 5 RB in James RB1nson. RB1nson has been spectacular and everything the Hobos hoped for. Given Malik Turner's current problems at running back, it's easy to assume they wish they could take this trade back. <br>
<strong>Winner: Hyperhobos </strong> <br><br>

<strong>The Hobos Strike Again<br></strong>
Hobolopolis Hyperhobos trade: DJ Moore, Cooper Kupp, Raheem Mostert<br>
Best Loser: Christian McCaffery, A.J Green<br>

Best Loser abandoned their previous name as a result of this trade. Best Loser got about a game and a half out of Mostert before he went right back to IR. Mostert might not be back until week 12 or later, far too late to be of any help in Best Loser's playoff push. DJ Moore actually had a pretty good stretch of 3 games before doing nothing last week. The verdict is still out Moore. Kupp has been solid, nothing spectacular though. Overall, the kind of return you want for a #2 pick. The Hobos almost immedietely dropped AJ Green and managed to claw their way to a 6-2 record despite CMC sitting on the bench. Now with CMC set to return, the Hobos get to reap the benefits without having given much up. <br>
<strong>Winner: Hyperhobos </strong> <br><br>

<strong>WTF is Cunt Thinking?<br></strong>
LeGarrette Cunt: Austin Ekeler, Damien Harris, Darius Slayton<br>
Belchers Pistol Offense: Chris Godwin, La'Mical Perine<br>

Our only explanation for this trade is that Cunt believed that La'Mical Perine was about to take over the starting job in the high powered Jets offense. He didn't. Frank Gore is still the guy. Amusingly, Damien Harris had a 16 carry, 16 point game the week after Cunt traded him away. Harris is flat out a better fantasy option than Perine. <br>
So that leaves Godwin. Surely Cunt must of really wanted Godwin and seen something in him, despite being injured, and despite Antonio Brown threatening to steal target share. <br>
Not even a week passes before Cunt offers up Godwin for, "a RB with two working legs". We'll have to wait and see what happens to Godwin, but at the moment we just don't see the logic for making this trade. <br>
We haven't even mentioned Ekeler. Ekeler is a wildcard due to the uncertainty of his return, but he is the clear best player in this deal and will create a lot of regret for Cunt if he comes back any time soon.
<strong>Winner: Belcher's Pistol Offense</strong> <br><br>

# Around the Hobo:
* The Hyperhobos have nabbed Dez Bryant; he is expected to instantly take over the Ravens WR1 spot.
* Braxton Barrios kicked to the curb after an amazing 8 catch game. 
* Jesse James still in free agency. 

# Week 9 Predictions

<strong>Hyperhobos vs Belcher’s Pistol Offense</strong><br>
The Hobo debut of Justin Herbert, Antonio Brown, and Christian McCaffery is going to be a massive blowout victory over the outmatched Belcher’s Pistol Offense.

<strong>Gelato #98 vs The One Inch Wonder</strong><br>
Gucci DiNucci didn’t work out so well for CeeDee Lamb. We don’t expect Garrett Gilbert to be much better. Pretend the flex spot is empty; that’s how much help Lamb will be this week. Aaron Jones already returned on Thursday, putting up decent numbers. Stefon Diggs has a good matchup against Seattle, but we still like The One Inch Wonder in this matchup. Michael Thomas is going to have a big return and single handedly sink Gelato. 

<strong>Macho Mel vs Team Striegel</strong><br>
Macho Mel is in a big hole right off the gate due to the continued insane play of Davante Adams, and a solid game from Sleeper Agent Jerrick McKinnon. After weeks of putting up amazing numbers on the bench, Mel is finally starting Brandin Cooks again. Expect him to take a back seat to Randall Cobb and score less than 5 points. Striegel wins. 

<strong>LeGarrette Cunt vs Malik Turner’s Playoff Catch %</strong><br>
Jordan Reed had a rough game and contributed nothing, but we’re still betting on Catch % to end Cunt’s win streak. Regardless of who wins though, we can guarantee that this will be an ugly, low scoring mud-slinging catastrophe of a game. 

<strong>Best Loser vs Team Hide and Zeke</strong><br>
Mike Davis is gone. Elliot is on bye. Hide and Zeke better pray that Arians gives RoJo another shot at being the main ball carrier, or else they’re in for a rough week. Still, Best Loser isn’t in a much better spot in regards to running backs. If neither Chris Carson or Carlos Hyde suit up tomorrow, this match is going to Hide and Zeke.

<strong>Sarah Please Take Me Back vs No Kap</strong><br>
Upset of the week. No Kap’s hype train comes to a screech halt as everything miraculously comes together for Sarah Please Take me back. Sarah barely wins.
