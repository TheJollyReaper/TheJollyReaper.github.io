<h1>Let the Floodgates Open</h1>

<p>And let the trades rush forth. Early in the morning, in the dead dark of night, team Macho Mel swindled LeGarrette Cunt into giving away their best player for a pair of scrubs. Our insider sources have confirmed that Leonard Fournette and Julio Jones are now Melians, while the Browns (AJ and Marquise) have been sentenced to serve on LeGarrette Cunt. This is very questionable trade for LeGarrette Cunt. It has been well known that Macho Mel has been trying to ship off Marquise and AJ for days now (the Hyperhobos themselves rejected several offers involving those two), and Mel got a surprisingly good haul in return. Julio Jones is one of the top receivers in fantasy every single year, and did not dissapoint even a little bit with his 19.5 outing in week 1. In exchange Cunt got a pair of supbar WR’s, one of which who is injured and could be out several weeks, to add to his collection of subpar receivers in Slayton and Allen. LeGarrette Cunt is going to have to make some deep organizational changes and do some soul searching, because this trade was Bill O’Brien levels of awful.</p>

<div id="around-the-hobo" class="section level1">
<h1>Around the Hobo:</h1>
<ul>
<li>Hobos are fielding offers for #1 RB Ronald Jones. Act fast, his value is only going to skyrocket in the next few weeks</li>
<li>The One Inch Wonder is reportedly thinking about blowing up their team completely once they lose this week</li>
<li>Macho Mel searching for new supplier of alien steroids</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="week-2-predictions" class="section level1">
<h1>Week 2 Predictions</h1>
<p><strong>Hyperhobos vs Malik Turners Playoff Catch %</strong> <br>
Both teams are battling with injuries this week. Malik Turners Playoff Catch % is missing both Kenny Golladay and Jamison Crowder, while both Courtland Sutton and DeVante Parker are questionable. If all four receivers are out, Malik Turner at the moment won’t have enough receivers on the roster to field a complete lineup. On the other end George Kittle, who is more valuable than all four of those players, has just been confirmed to be out this week against the Jets. Despite this grave handicap, the Hyperhobos have too much star power for Malik Turner to handle. This game should be an easy blowout victory for the Hobos.</p>
<p><strong>Sarah Please Take Me Back vs Macho Mel</strong><br>
Miles Sanders is back for Mel after missing last week, but AJ Brown is out. In replacing him is the surprising Parris Campbell. Sarah Please Take Me Back is at full “strength”, but if Josh Jacobs is thrown out by himself like last week, they don’t stand much of a chance. James Conner, Engram, and Mason Crosby are all going to have to step up big time. Macho Mel should get the victory though in typical late comeback fashion.</p>
<p><strong>Team Hide and Zeke vs The One Inch Wonder</strong><br>
The bottom two ranked teams. The only two teams to receive “F” grades on their drafts. Team Hide and Zeke and The One Inch Wonder will engage in epic battle to decide early on in the season who truly is the worst team in the league. We don’t think it’s physically, theoretically, or logically possible to lose to a team starting Antonio Gibson, James White, and Jerry Jeudy; so we have to favor Hide and Zeke here. They should be able to cruise to their first victory.</p>
<p><strong>LeGarrette Cunt vs Gelato #41</strong><br>
LeGarrette Cunt is making some head scratching lineup decisions. Russell Gage and a great game last week, but he’s on the bench. Game 1 Sammy Watkins is in the starting lineup instead. When Watkins ends up with 1 catch and less than 3 fantasy points, Cunt is going to severely regret this decision. Going down both lineups, Cunt is completely outmatched in every way possible. Massive blowout for Gelato. <br>
<strong><i>edit: Cunt decided to tank their longterm potential by sending away Julio Jones. Watkins is on the bench now, but the absence of Jones will bring even greater harm. Expect an even larger blowout in favor for Gelato.</i></strong></p>
<p><strong>Belchers Pistol Offense vs Team Striegel</strong><br>
The loss of Chris Godwin is too much for Belchers Pistol Offense to overcome. On the other side Chubb and Beckham rebounded in a big way to give them a substantial early lead. This match could continue to get ugly fast in favor of Striegel.</p>
<p><strong>No Kap vs Moneyball Cockmonger</strong><br>
This match should be close, but we like Cockmonger here. Joe Mixon has already underperformed with his 10 point performance on Thursday, and Newton is going to have an awful day against the Seattle defense. Victory is going to Autocock.</p>
