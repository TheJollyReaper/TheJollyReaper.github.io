# The First Souls Have Been Claimed

*Corona is devasting teams around the league*
</center>

A serious case of contagious alcoholism is spreading like wildfire across Ray Rice's Left Hook. Several teams have already felt the effects and will now go into week 4 missing several key players due to massive hangovers. We managed to get commissioner Jose's thoughts on the matter. <br> <br>
<i>
  “He got me,” Jose said over corona spreading across the league. "That f***ing corona boomed me."
  Jose added, “He’s so good,” repeating it four times.
  Jose then said he wanted to add Corona to the list of beers he drinks this summer.

# Around the Hobo
* New home for Sterling Shephard. The cruel Macho Mel kicked Shephard to the curb after he was placed on IR. Now in a much better environment, Shephard is projected to average 15+ points once he returns from injury. 
* Trade! Mel sent J.K Dobbins to Hide and Zeke in exchange for Brandin Cooks. In the short term this might help out Mel given all the absences the team will have this week. Hide and Zeke is gambling that Dobbins will be somewhat useful at some point this season. It won't happen. 
* LeGarrette Cunt reportedly petioning commisioner Jose to restart the season with a new draft. 

# Week 4 Predictions

<strong>Hyperhobos vs Macho Mel</strong><br>
Very bad news for Macho Mel. Edwards-Helaire will likely be out this week due to corona consumption. Julio Jones will not be at 100% even if he does play. And Leonard Fournette is out, which gives a big boost to the Hobos Ronald Jones. On the Hobo side, Mostert is still out, but John Brown is healthy and ready to play. Mel was already facing a steep uphill battle, but if either Jones or Helaire are out this week (or even both), this should be a much easier win for the Hobos than expected.

<strong>The One Inch Wonder vs Malik Turner’s Playoff Catch %</strong><br>
No one is getting hit harder by the potential cancellation of the Pats-Chiefs game than The One Inch Wonder. If it doesn’t happen this Monday or Tuesday, The One Inch Wonder will be down 8 players. Minshew and Hill will likely get the start, but the roster does not have a backup tight end or kicker. Inch likely have to drop Carlos Hyde, and then the team will have a very tough decision to make about the 2nd player to drop. Malik Turner on the other hand is relatively unscathed; they even get George Kittle back this week. Easy win for Catch %. 

<strong>Sarah Please End Corona vs Team Hide and Zeke</strong><br>
Sarah is another big corona casualty. Sony Michel could be out, Tyreke Hill could be out, Juju is out, James Conner is out, Adam Humphries is out! As things stand right now, blowout victory for Hide and Zeke. 

<strong>Moneyball Cockmonger vs Gelato #41</strong><br>
Although we feel like Cockmonger has a solid shot at an upset here, we have to go with Gelato. Russell Wilson is going to score at least 6 touchdowns in an epic dual against Fitzmagic and carry Gelato to victory. 

<strong>Team Striegel vs No Kap</strong><br>
Despite having a very disappointing game last week, the loss of Cam Newton is huge for No Kap. Newton was the key part of Kap’s wins the first two weeks of the season, and Brady is just not going to be able to replicate that. With the return of Davante Adams, Striegel’s getting the upset of the week. 

<strong>LeGarrette Cunt vs Belchers Pistol Offense</strong><br>
No Henry, no Godwin, no win. Cunt is getting their first win of the season.
<br><br>
If Cunt doesn’t win this, the team is going 0-12.
