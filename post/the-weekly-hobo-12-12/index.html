<div id="championship-bracket" class="section level1">
<h1>Championship Bracket</h1>
<p><em>These teams are fighting for the prestigious RRLH Championship</em></p>
<p><strong>Hobolopolis Hyperhobos vs No Kap</strong><br>
The Hobo’s spotted No Kap a sizable lead last week; just enough to give them a bit of hope. The Hobo’s have decided to hold out Christian McCaffery one more week, just to keep things fair for poor No Kap. Gallman and Coutee’s combined 60 points this week will power the Hobo’s to the championship match.</p>
<p><strong>Sarah Please Take Me Back vs Gelato #41</strong><br>
Everything went wrong for Sarah. Bad JuJu appeared, McClaurin had his lowest scoring game of the year, and Tyreke Hill had his second lowest score of the year. Gelato, predictably got nothing from their RB2, but otherwise had a very solid week. <br></p>
<p>Todd Gurley returned last week but had an unspectacular outing while on the bench. If he can return to form, it’ll bring a much needed boost for Gelato. On the other hand, Sarah is going to greatly regret not starting Cam Akers. He put up 20 points while sitting on the bench this past thursday. Still despite all the shortcomings for Sarah, the lead is still manageable. Tyreke Hill can turn things around and win the game single handidly for Sarah; no one on Gelato has as much scoring potential as Hill. <br></p>
<p>In the end, we predict Sarah coming back and narrowly stealing the win.</p>
</div>
<div id="consolation-bracket" class="section level1">
<h1>Consolation Bracket</h1>
<p><em>These teams are the best that the league has to offer, after you seperate the actual best. These teams have a shot at ending #5, the best case scenerio for the consolation teams.</em></p>
<p><strong>The One Inch Wonder vs Belcher’s Pistol Offense</strong><br>
A paltry 6 points from the running backs didn’t stop The One Inch Wonder from building a narrow lead. The pass catchers went on a complete rampage; the lowest scoring WR/TE on the starting lineup was Tyler Boyd with 13.5 points. <br>
In a surprising turn of events, the Patriots defense have kept Belcher’s Pistol Offense in the game with a team high 28 points. Those 28 points match what the Patriots defense had done the previous 9 weeks combined. They did go back to being crap with 3 points this week though. <br></p>
<p>Both teams are missing their RB2 this week: Gaskin out for Belcher, Gibson out for Inch. Gaskin’s loss is a much larger blow. We like The One Inch Wonder’s chances to hold on for the victory.</p>
<p><strong>Malik Turner’s Playoff Catch % vs Team Hide and Zeke</strong><br>
As predicted, Malik Turner’s Playoff Catch % goes into this week with a sizeable lead. We will stick with our prediction of Hide and Zeke making a comeback victory. It is time for Elliot to rise from the ashes and lead Hide and Zeke to the promised land.</p>
</div>
<div id="losers-bracket" class="section level1">
<h1>Loser’s Bracket</h1>
<p><em>Whoever loses both rounds in the Loser’s bracket is truly the worst team in the league. Only these four teams can end up in the coveted #12 spot.</em></p>
<p><strong>Macho Mel vs LeGarrette Cunt</strong><br>
<i>“There is really no scenario where Cunt can beat Mel in a 2-game matchup, the talent difference between rosters is just too much.”</i> <br></p>
<p>Turns out there is a scenario where Cunt can beat Mel in a 2-game matchup. A mysterious “illness” (Hobo Curse) claimed Clyde Edwards-Helaire knocking him out of last weeks game, and Doug Pederson continues to suffer from a bad case of “stupidity”, leading to Myles Sanders being ignored in the offense week after week. Chase Claypool also had one of his worst games this season, and now Julio Jones is out this week. Despite all of that though, the game is still close. Despite LeGarrette Cunt’s roster being awful, a miracle performance from Darren Waller is what has built up their narrow lead. <br></p>
<p>Due to Mel obviously being cursed, this game is going to be very, very close. We believe Mel should barely, by the slimmest of margins, find a way to steal this one.</p>
<p><strong>Team Striegel vs Best Loser</strong><br>
Very close game, but again as predicted, Striegel has the lead. We fully expect to regret this, but we’ve predicting a Striegel win.</p>
