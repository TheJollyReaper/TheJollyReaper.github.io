<em>The league is doing everything possible to handicap the Hobos</em>
</center>
<p>In an unprecedented abuse of power, the league is forcing two of the Hyperhobo’s key starters (Christian McCaffery and Antonio Brown) to go on bye this week; which as you know is also the first week of the playoffs. Never before have the clear championship favorites been given such a heavy handicap during the playoffs. Critics around the world are calling for justice and demanding for the league’s insane handicap on the Hyperhobo’s to be called off. <br><br>
The Hobo’s for their part, are not worried. Team Captain Wayne Gallman expressed confidence in the team’s ability to hold down the fort during the first half of this round of the playoffs. He said it wouldn’t be fair for the vastly outmatched No Kap to have to go up against a full power Hobo’s squad for two weeks, and that it was only fair to give them a glimmer of hope. <br><br>
Exports don’t disagree. This year’s first round match-up between the Hyperhobos and No Kap is projected to be one of the most lopsided beatdowns in playoff history. These two teams had very different paths to the playoffs. The Hyperhobos have been a dominant force all season and cruised to a division title. Meanwhile, No Kap barely managed to claw their way to the playoffs thanks to a few lucky bounces. The Hyperhobos have a much stronger team in every area of the game; even their bench alone would be enough to crush No Kap, despite half the bench being on IR. <br><br>
So despite the inherent unfairness of having to start the first week of the playoffs with two of their best players on the bench, in reality this is the only way to have a truly fair matchup between the Hyperhobos and No Kap. Even though No Kap is at full health with all their best players available this week, they still have a monumental challenge ahead of them.</p>

<h1>Round One: First Half Predictions</h1>
</div>
<div id="championship-bracket" class="section level1">
<h1>Championship Bracket</h1>
<p><em>These teams are fighting for the prestigious RRLH Championship</em></p>
<p><strong>Hobolopolis Hyperhobos vs No Kap</strong><br>
No Kap is being given every possible advantage they can get in this match, with both Christian McCaffery and AB being held out for the first half of this matchup. Despite this obvious handicap, the Hobos completely outclass No Kap in every position. Expect the Hobos to immediately jump out to a huge lead by the end of the week.</p>
<p><strong>Sarah Please Take Me Back vs Gelato #41</strong><br>
No Josh Jacobs or James Conner absolutely kills Sarah Please Take Me Back. As the Jacobs owner in this league, it is downright puzzling how Sarah allowed ignored the Raider’s RB situation and allowed Devontae Booker to go to the Hobo’s in free agency. As a result, Gelato is nicely positioned for a really good start to this playoff matchup. <br><br>
Unless Tyreke Hill drops 50 again. If that happens Gelato is fucked.</p>
</div>
<div id="consolation-bracket" class="section level1">
<h1>Consolation Bracket</h1>
<p><em>These teams are the best that the league has to offer, after you seperate the actual best. These teams have a shot at ending #5, the best case scenerio for the consolation teams.</em></p>
<p><strong>The One Inch Wonder vs Belcher’s Pistol Offense</strong><br>
Belcher’s Pistol Offense has to be the favorite to take the #5 spot. Ekeler’s return really pushes Belcher to the top of the crap pile. You also can’t forget about the return of Gaskin and Adam Thielen. The One Inch Wonder really has no shot in this matchup.</p>
<p><strong>Malik Turner’s Playoff Catch % vs Team Hide and Zeke</strong><br>
After being in control of a playoff spot much of the regular season, Malik Turner’s Playoff Catch % collapsed down the stretch and limped their way into the consolation bracket. Luckily they get an easy first round match against Hide and Zeke who has four starters out due to injury and/or byes. Malik Turner should be able to get a sizeable lead by the end of the week, but they’ll likely give it up next week.</p>
</div>
<div id="losers-bracket" class="section level1">
<h1>Loser’s Bracket</h1>
<p><em>Whoever loses both rounds in the Loser’s bracket is truly the worst team in the league. Only these four teams can end up in the coveted #12 spot.</em></p>
<p><strong>Macho Mel vs LeGarrette Cunt</strong><br>
The 3-peat is dead. After two straight titles, Mel is now at the bottom of the standings with the worst record in the Try Hard division. Both Cunt and Mel had similar paths to this point. Both teams were awful to start the season, got hot for a stretch and at one point looked like they could sneak into the playoffs, but both team ran out of gas and fell short. <br><br>
Overall, Mel has a much more complete team. Despite the Eagles unwillingness to use him, Miles Sanders is still vastly superior by himself than all of Cunt’s RB’s combined. Mel also has a much, much better receiving core even with Julio potentially sitting this week. There is really no scenario where Cunt can beat Mel in a 2-game matchup, the talent difference between rosters is just too much.</p>
<p><strong>Team Striegel vs Best Loser</strong><br>
Striegel should win this. In theory, Striegel should have won a lot of games this season; they were firmly in the top half in total points. Still, week after week Striegel manages to find ways to lose. Despite that though, we feel that a 2-game series mitigates some of Striegel’s awful ability to somehow always lose. Stretching a matchup across 2 games should allow Striegel’s roster a chance to not fuck up. <br><br>
But on the other hand, Best Loser’s squad of ex-Hobo’s (Mostert, Kupp, Moore, and Gesicki) may have just enough magic left to send Striegel to the dreaded fight for #12 round. <br><br>
All in all, at least for this week Striegel will have the lead.</p>
