*Basically Everyone but the Hobos Sucks*
</center>

<strong>Division Leaders:</strong><br>
Gelato #51 - The unquestioned rulers of the Hardly Trying Division, Gelato is currently cruising to a division title. Thanks to their week 1 victory over Belchers Pistol Offense, Gelato effectively has a 2 game lead over Belcher. Gelato also has a tiebreaker win over No Kap, giving Gelato a 3 game cushion against them. There is a lot of breathing room for Gelato with 6 games left to go.

Hobolopolis Hyperhobos - The Try Hard division is in a very similar position as the Hardly Trying division. Due to tie breaking victories over both Malik Turner and Macho Mel, the Hobos respectively have a 2 and 3 game lead over them. The Hobos have a bit less breathing room then Gelato due to their loss against Hide and Zeke. 

<strong>Wild Cards</strong><br>
Malik Turner's Playoff Catch % - Catch % is in at the moment, but they have a tough task ahead of them. The loss against the Hobos greatly hurts Turner's chances at taking the division title, and the loss to Hide and Zeke could potentially take them out of the playoffs completely if they end up with the same record. They also have a really tough schedule to end the season; their last 3 opponents are Belcher, Gelato, and No Kap. Those 3 games will have massive implications in the playoff picture.

Belcher's Pistol Offense - Belcher's Pistol Offense has to be heavily favored to keep one of the four playoff spots. Their early season loss against Gelato hurts, but given their 4 game winning streak they have a shot at passing Gelato. The wins over No Kap and Hide and Zeke are a huge boost to their playoff chances. 

<strong>In the Hunt</strong><br>
Macho Mel, Team Hide and Zeke, No Kap - These 3 teams are currently at 3-3. All of them have potentially crippling tie breaking losses against the current playoff leaders and all of them have huge flaws that could spell disaster for their season. Despite their recent sucess, Team Hide and Zeke has been overly dependant on Mike Davis to get those wins. Davis won't be around forever. Macho Mel has consistently looked awful all season, with the exception of a huge win last week. We're not to confident that last week was a sign that Mel is turning things around. No Kap started out really strong, but has been awful these past few weeks. We don't see them coming back to challenge for a playoff spot.

<strong>Maybe</strong><br>
LeGarrette Cunt - Cunt does have two wins in a row, they could potentially steal the 4th playoff spot. Maybe.

<strong>Predictions</strong> <br>
Hobos, Gelato, and Belcher are basically a lock for the playoffs. Malik and Mel will have a pillow fight to decide who gets the last spot. 

# Around the Hobo
* IR spot added! Bring out your dead!
* Mr. Big Chest is back!! The Hobos will hugely benefit from his 2 games of production before he gets arrested
* JaMycal Hasty predicted to be the top scoring RB in fantasy throughout the rest of the season

# Week 7 Predictions

<strong>Hyperhobos vs Team Striegel</strong><br>
Top ranked team vs lowest ranked team. This should be a massacre. The Hobos have already gotten off to a very strong start behind Wentz, Full Ham, and Shepard. The lead is already too great for Striegel to overcome. 

<strong>Gelato #61 vs Team Hide and Zeke</strong><br>
Gelato left an IR player on the lineup, giving Gelato a nice 0 in the TE slot for the week. Despite the handicap, this should still be a very close matchup. It’ll come down to the health status of Aaron Jones and DeAndre Hopkins. Hopkins especially; he’ll have an amazing matchup against Seattle if he plays. It’s a Gelato victory if both of them are active, but a Hide and Zeke win if either of them are gone. There’s not enough depth on Gelato’s roster to replace them on short notice. 

<strong>Sarah Please Take Me Back vs Belchers Pistol Offense</strong><br>
There’s too much bad Juju in Sarah Please Take Me Back. Belcher wins. 

<strong>Malik Turner’s Playoff Catch % vs Best Loser</strong><br>
The upset of the week; Best Loser will have a huge victory here behind the revival of Tyler Lockett. 

<strong>The One Inch Wonder vs LeGarrette Cunt</strong><br>
We want to say The One Inch Wonder has a chance at an upset here, but it’s so hard to believe in a team that has Brian Hill in the starting lineup. Cunt wins. 

<strong>Macho Mel vs No Kap</strong><br>
Bad start for Mel. Starting a defense against the high powered Full Ham offense is never a good idea. No Kap also has Melvin Gordon returning to the lineup this week. We like No Kap by a large margin.
