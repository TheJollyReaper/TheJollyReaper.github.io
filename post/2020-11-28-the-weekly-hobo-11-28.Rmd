# Week 12 Predictions

<strong>Hyperhobos vs Best Lobster</strong><br>
Loser gets both Carson and Mostert back, a fearsome duo to add to what was already a good RB roster with Hunt and David Johnson. Too bad they won’t be in any meaningful games this postseason. The Hobos Fulgham gets a nice matchup against Seattle this week, setting up the Hobos for a nice dress rehearsal before the playoffs. 

<strong>Macho Mel vs Gelato #41</strong><br>
Mel is off to a good start with 10.5 points from Cooks and Hockenson each. With Justice Hill starting for Gelato, we like Mel’s chances in this one. 

<strong>Team Hide and Zeke vs Belcher’s Pistol Offense</strong><br>
It all comes down to this for Hide and Zeke. A win takes them to the playoffs, and a loss sends them to the consolation ladder. <br><br>
And at the moment it sure looks like consolation ladder is the destination. Hide and Zeke had a horrible Thursday; Ezekial Elliot and Jordan Akins combined for 1.5 points. To make matters worse, Dobbins is out with Corona after a career game last week. And to make matters even WORSE for Hide and Zeke, Ekeler is returning this week for Pistol Offense. Still, Pistol Offense isn’t at full strength either. Brown is out, Thielen is out, Gaskin is still out, and you can expect the Patriots defense to do nothing like always. We still like Hide and Zeke somehow sneaking out with a victory. 

<strong>Sarah Please Take Me Back vs LeGarrette Cunt</strong><br>
This matchup will be decided by which Colt’s RB has a bigger game. Our money is on Cunt getting blown out in an awful lopsided affair. 

<strong>Team Striegel vs The One Inch Wonder</strong><br>
What a monster Thursday for The One Inch Wonder; 3 players combined for 65 points. Given this start and all the injuries Striegel is dealing with, this one shouldn’t be close. Easy win for The One Inch Wonder. 

<strong>Malik Turner’s Playoff Catch % vs No Kap</strong><br>
Explosive starts by both teams, but it’s sure looking like a safe bet that No Kap is going to knock Catch % out of the playoffs this week.
