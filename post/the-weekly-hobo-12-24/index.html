<h1>Hobolopolis Throws Massive Championship Parade</h1>

<em>The Ultimate Prize</em>
</center>
<p>As we all know, due to Corona and increasing cases of Spontaneous Explosive Cell Death (SECD) the playoffs for RRLH were sadly cancelled. Thanks to their division win and dominant regular season performance, the BCS awarded the RRLH National Championship to the Hobolopolis Hyperhobos. <br><br>
Right after The Hobo News Network announced the results of the season on the one TV in all of Hobolopolis, the entire city broke out into celebration. Ex-Hobo and RRLH Hall of Famer Charlie Whitehurst was in attendance and described the festivities as, “neat”. Truly sounds like they had one crazy party.</p>
</div>
<div id="predictions-for-the-final-round-of-the-rrlh-post-season-exhibition-tournament" class="section level1">
<h1>Predictions for the final round of the RRLH post-season exhibition tournament</h1>
<p><strong>No Kap vs Gelato #41</strong><br>
Amari Cooper, 2 points. Michael Pittman Jr. 2 points. Rams D 4 points. Jason Sanders 1 points. These four players account for almost half of No Kap’s starting line up and they got 9 points total. Younghoe Koo, 11 points. Younghoe Koo by himself outscored 40% of No Kap’s lineup all by himself. <br><br>
Yet despite that, Gelato is down 23 points. Something is seriously wrong here. Gelato is falling apart at the seams and collapsing in a way we have never seen before. The sheer ineptitude necessary to squander a superstar such as Younghoe Koo in the Grandest Stage of them all is mind boggling. Low energy Russell Wilson and eternal disappointment Robby Anderson are going to have to start pulling their weight this week to help Koo get his rightful exhibition tournament MVP award. <br><br>
Gelato has a tough task ahead digging out of this hole against a surging No Kap. No Kap have received a blessing from the Hobo’s in the form of Mike Gesickgod. Gesickgod has single handily carried No Kap through the post-season exhibition tournament and if his play keeps up, No Kap will very likely claim the title of exhibition champ.</p>
<p><strong>Sarah Please Take Me Back vs Hobolopolis Hyperhobos </strong><br>
Rough week for Sarah Please Take Me Back. They got absolutely crushed despite the Hobo’s only using 5% of their full power. It was so bad that Christian McCaffery decided to sit out again this week out of pity. The deficit is insurmountable and is expected to grow even larger in this last week of competition. Horrible way to end the season for Sarah.</p>
<p><strong>Malik Turner’s Playoff Catch % vs The One Inch Wonder </strong><br>
Eagles offense is suddenly decent, and all it took was a competent QB. Jalen Hurts ascendance has pushed Malik Turner’s Playoff Catch % to the next level. His 37 points are leading the way in an absolute beatdown of The One Inch Wonder. The One Inch Wonder is going to have a tough time catching up without a QB of Hurts’ caliber. Patrick Mahomes just isn’t in the same league. Malik Turner is winning this.</p>
<p><strong>Macho Mel vs Belcher’s Pistol Offense </strong><br>
The death of Derek Carr is hitting Mel hard. Still, only a 9 point difference seperates Mel and Belcher. We strongly believe Belcher is going to choke and lose the game due to the Patriots defense putting in negative points this week.</p>
<p><strong>Best Loser vs Team Hide and Zeke </strong><br>
aannnnnnnddddddddddd Mostert is injured. Again. <br><br>
So like we said last week Team Hide and Zeke is going to win.</p>
<p><strong>Team Striegel vs LeGarrette Cunt </strong><br>
We knew Striegel was going to lose, but we thought they would at least keep things close at least for the 1st week before choking on week 2 for maximum disappointment. The sad thing is, Striegel would actually be winning if the organization hadn’t given up and waved the white. The bench scored 75 points, almost as much as the starting lineup. <br><br>
Congratulations to LeGarrette Cunt for not being the worst.</p>
