*This division sucks*
</center>

Not a single team in the hardly trying division won a game this past week. NOT ONE. 

# Around the Hobo
* Kalen Ballage taking over the Chargers starting job? 
* Congrats to Best Loser for being the first team to drop from #1 to #12 in ESPN's projections over the course of a season
* 8 teams have 4-5 wins. Party in mediocrity!

# Week 10 Predictions

<strong>Hyperhobos vs Gelato #41</strong><br>
Two division leaders trending in very different directions. While Gelato has piled up loss after loss in recent weeks, the Hobos stand uncontested at the top of the mountain. Despite Christian McCaffery going back on vacation for the foreseeable future, the unstoppable duo of Wayne Gallman and RB1nson is more than enough to crush Gelato. 

<strong>Belchers Pistol Offense vs Malik Turner’s Playoff Catch %</strong><br>
Belcher’s collection of injured RBs won’t help them here, easy win for Catch %.

<strong>Macho Mel vs LeGarrette Cunt</strong><br>
Cunt is off to a very rough start this week with AJ Brown getting completely shut down by the menacing Colts defense. This will likely be another close match, but there’s no reason to believe Macho Mel won’t pull it off.

<strong>No Kap vs The One Inch Wonder</strong><br>
Blowout victory for The One Inch Wonder.

<strong>Team Striegel vs Team Hide and Zeke</strong><br>
At some point Striegel’s awful luck has to end and they’ll get a win. <br>
Not this week though. Chubb’s return won’t stop Hide and Zeke’s march to the playoffs.

<strong>Best Loser vs Sarah Please Take Me Back</strong><br>
Carson out, David Johnson is out, Carlos Hyde is out, Raheem Mostert it out, Kareem Hunt is losing snaps to the returning Chubb; it seems Best Loser is waving the white flag and not even bothering to find a RB2 for this week. This match should be an easy victory for Sarah.
