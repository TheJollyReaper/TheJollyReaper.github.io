      <description>There’s a new sheriff in townAnd his name is Mike GesickiIf someone were to ask you who the number one tight end in fantasy was, what would you say? Travis Kelce? George Kittle? The ghost of Rob Gronkowski? If your response would be any of those, you would be incorrect. Horribly incorrect. As of this very moment the #1 tight end according to total fantasy points is none other than Mike “The God” Gesicki.</description>

Our insider sources have confirmed that Leonard Fournette and Julio Jones are now Melians, while the Browns (AJ and Marquise) have been sentenced to serve on LeGarrette Cunt. This is a very questionable trade for LeGarrette Cunt.</description>
