# We're nearing the end of another season

*The Ultimate Prize*
</center>

This season has brought many surprises, such as the fall of the tyrannical Mel dynasty and the death of practically every RB in the league. It was another highly competitive season that came down to the final week of the regular season. As we look forward to the end of the postseason, always remember that Sarah Please Take Me Back (who used to be known as Fourth and Inches) scored 37.5 points in week 7 of our 2019 season, by far the worst game in our league history (post paid-entry).  

# RRLH CHAMPIONSHIP
<strong>No Kap vs Gelato #41</strong><br>
QB: Tom Brady vs Russell Wilson <br>
Wilson's game has dipped in recent weeks. Seattle's offense hasn't looked nearly as explosive or dangerous as it did at the start of the season. Tomorrow they go up against a suddenly ferocious Washington defense that will very likely rip apart Seattle's Oline like wet tissue paper and be in Russell's face all day. On the other side, Tom Brady has a much nicer matchup against the Falcons. Brady though has been very inconsistent all year long and has thrown 7 interceptions in his last 5 games. Despite having a much tougher matchup, Wilson has a higher floor and so we're giving Gelato the edge on QB's. <br>

RB'S: Dalvin Cook & Melvin Gordon vs Aaron Jones & Todd Gurley <br>
Each team has already had one RB play this week: Kap's Melvin Gordon put in 22 points, while Gelato's Aaron Jones finished just below Gordon with 21.5 points. Comparing Dalvin Cook to Todd Gurley is a no brainer. Pick any single one of Cook's games, and he would have scored more that Gurley has in his last 5 games combined. No Kap will definitely have a massive advantage when it comes to RB's this week. <br>

WR's: Amari Cooper & Calvin Ridley & Corey Davis vs DeAndre Hopkins & Stefon Diggs & Robby Anderson <br>
This one shouldn't be in question. Gelato has perhaps the strongest receiving trio in the league. But! As we speak Robby Anderson is on his way to delivering his worst game of the season with a pathetic 3 points. On the other side, with Julio Jones ruled out for this week Calvin Ridley is expected to have a monster game. We're giving the receiving edge to No Kap. <br>

TE: Hunter Henry vs Eric Ebron <br>
Henry seems to have both a lower floor and a higher ceiling than Ebron, and it appears that he hit the ceiling this week with 14.5 points. There's no way Ebron matches that. Advantage No Kap. <br>

Flex: Michael Pittman Jr. vs Brandon Aiyuk <br>
Easy and clear advantage for Aiyuk and the Gelatos. <br>

Defense: Rams vs Steelers <br>
Both teams have very, very nice matchups. Rams get the terrifying Jets offense, while the Steelers have to handle... (checks notes) Ryan Finley? Both defenses are going to feast. Tie I guess. <br>

Kicker: YOUNGHOE KOO FUCK NO KAP KOO IS LEADING GELATO TO THE CHAMPIONSHIP

<strong>Sarah Please Take Me Back vs Hobolopolis Hyperhobos </strong><br>
Herbear came back strong after a rough couple weeks. Hobo's appear to be firing on all cylinders early on in this matchup. This is looking like it's going to be a blowout in favor of Hobolopolis. 

<strong>Malik Turner's Playoff Catch % vs The One Inch Wonder </strong><br>
It was a nice dream while it lasted, but Michael Thomas is now on IR and done for the fantasy season. Combine that with a sad RB combination of Gus Edwards and Lynn Bowden Jr., and it's easy to see why Malik Turner is going to completely dominate this round. 

<strong>Macho Mel vs Belcher's Pistol Offense </strong><br>
Rough break for Mel as Derek Carr only managed to put up 2 points before taken out of the game. Luckily for Mel, Belcher has appeared to wave the white flag. There are two players on Belcher's rosters likely putting up zero's this week, and there are no replacements on the bench. Belcher has a bit of emergency roster management to do before tomorrow to have a shot. <br>
Mel's going to crush them either way regardless. 

<strong>Best Loser vs Team Hide and Zeke </strong><br>
Hide and Zeke is leaving a ton of points on the bench so far. We're going with Best Loser.

<strong>Team Striegel vs LeGarrette Cunt </strong><br>
Both teams had to suck really, really bad to get to this point. But here we are, the Toilet Bowl. The bottom of the consolation bracket. Whoever losses this round is truly the worst of the worst. <br>
Again. On paper Striegel has the better team. But they always manage to lose somehow! They had the last round practically handed to them, and they still somehow lost by 1.5 points! <br>
Cunt is winning. We don't care if Striegel swaps out Kerryon Johnson with DeAndre Swift or if Sammy Watkins somehow has a 2nd good game this season. Striegel will somehow lose and win the Toilet Bowl crown. Congratulations to LeGarrette Cunt for being only the 2nd worst team in the league.
