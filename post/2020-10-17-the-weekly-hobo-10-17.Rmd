# Team Striegel and LeGarrette Cunt Researching Fusion Techniques 
![](https://static3.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/DBZ-Fusion-Goku-and-Piccolo-Featured.jpg)
*The resulting team likely won't be much better though*
</center>

Banished to the depths of the Hardly Division, Team Striegel and LeGarrette Cunt live a miserable existence. Starved for a victory, constantly faced with hardship and dissapointment, both teams strive for an easy way out. Enter, Fusion. <br><br>

Team Striegel and LeGarrette Cunt are hoping to combine their franchises into a single <strike>superteam</strike> somewhat average team. There latest attempts have centered around DragonBall's fusion dance, alas it has yet to yield any results thus far. Should their efforts ever prove successful, we'll be looking at a team lead by Davente Adams, Adrian Peterson, ummm... Greg Zuerlein, and the ghost of Rob Gronkowski. That team may actually be good enough to pass Cockmonger and finish 3rd in the division. Maybe.

# Around the Hobo:
* Andy Dalton signed by the Hobos. Former "Red Rifle" of the Cincinnati Kitty Cats has a strong potential to be the best quarterback in the league the rest of the season
* Trade drought? Owners seem to be in a gridlock as we start entering an usually long stretch withot any trades
* Hobolopolis Hyperhobs awarded "Best Team Name" by the un-Associated Press


# Week 6 Predictions

<strong>Hyperhobos vs Mongolmoney Draftcock</strong><br>
Mongolcock’s Mostert, Moore, and Kupp will wilt under the pressure of facing their former team. On the other end, the reincarnation of Jerry Rice, Travis Fulgham is going to lead the Hobo’s on a massive win over Automongol. 

<strong>Gelato #51 vs Macho Mel</strong><br>
If there’s ever a week where Mel could beat Gelato, it’s this week. Mr. Unliiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiimiiiiiiiited is out for Gelato on bye. Prescott is out and this will be the first game CeeDee Lamb has with new QB Andy Dalton. Robby Anderson is up against a tough Bears defense. On the other end, Clyde has his swan song before he gets replaced by Bell. Julio Jones might finally be back. And all of the Steelers receivers not named Playpool have died. Given the circumstances, we’re giving the slight edge to Mel. 

<strong>Belchers Pistol Offense vs Team Hide and Zeke</strong><br>
Mike Davis rental is still active, dominant win for Hide and Zeke. 

<strong>LeGarrette Cunt vs Sarah Please Take Me Back</strong><br>
So it turns out Juju isn’t actually dead, Diontae Johnson was the only victim. Anyways, with Sarah missing Josh Jacobs and Cunt having the best one week rental in fantasy league history; this should be comfortable win for Cunt with Mattison leading the charge.

<strong>Team Striegel vs The One Inch Wonder</strong><br>
Striegel lost to a winless team last week, and now they get to lose to a one win team this week. Despite Inch not having Thomas, Bell, or Diontae Johnson on the lineup, the Striegel’s uncanny ability to always lose will grant Wonder the victory. 

<strong>No Kap vs Malik Turner’s Playoff Catch %</strong><br>
No Kap has a tough task ahead with both Dalvin Cook and Melvin Gordon out. It should be a very close match, but we like Turner’s chances here.
