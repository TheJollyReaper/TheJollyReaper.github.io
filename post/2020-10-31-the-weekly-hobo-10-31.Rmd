# Key Takeaways
<strong>The Hobo's schedule is perfect, but only for the Hobo's</strong><br>
The Hyperhobo's currently have a 6-1 record. If the Hyperhobo's had to go against anyone else's schedule up to this point in the season, their best possible record would 5-2 with either Hide and Zeke's or Sarah's schedule. That may make it seem like the Hobo's have an easy schedule, but consider this: if every team had the Hyperhobo's schedule, only Gelato #41 would match the Hobo's 6-1 record. The next best team would be No Kap at 5-2 and then everyone else would do signficantly worse. 

<strong>Striegel's getting screwed by their schedule</strong><br>
There is only one possible schedule that would have lead to Striegel having a 1-6 schedule: their own schedule. Out of the 12 schedules in the league, only two of them would have Striegel at 2 or less wins. Striegel definitely got the short end of the scheduling stick. If you were to count victories and losses against all teams every week, Striegel would be tied in 4th with a total record of 42-35. 

<strong>Only two teams could have possibly been winless up to this point</strong><br>
The One Inch Wonder with Macho Mel's schedule would be 0-7 right now, Team Hide and Zeke with No Kap's schedule would be 0-6-1.

<strong>The One Inch Wonder is truly the worst team in the league</strong>
With a combined record of 23-53-1

# Around the Hobo
* TRADE: Ekeler, Damien Harris, and Darius Slayton sent from LeGarrette Cunt to Belchers Pistol Offense for La'Mical Perine and Chris Godwin. Very puzzling trade. Cunt just tanked any shot they had at the playoffs for... basically nothing. 
* WAYNE GALLMAN IS THE PATH TO SALVATION
* Team Striegel dropped Sebastian Janikowski, WTF are they thinking!?

# Week 8 Predictions

<strong>Hyperhobos vs LeGarrette Cunt</strong><br>
Cunt may be benefitting from the absence of Miles Sanders, but even the rental of Boston Scott will not be enough to save them. The Prophet Wayne Gallman is going to shred the pathetic Tampa Bay defense and power the Hobos to a dominant blowout victory. 

<strong>Gelato #00 vs Sarah Please Take Me Back</strong><br>
Rex Burkhead is Gelato’s only back-up option for Aaron Jones right now. 	CeeDee Lamb’s quarterback is Ben DiNucci. Zach Ertz is out. Everything is pointing to a 3rd straight loss for Gelato.  

<strong>The One Inch Wonder vs Belchers Pistol Offense</strong><br>
The curse of the Patriots defense will cripple Belchers Pistol Offense. Expect The One Inch Wonder to somehow pull out a close win with a large amount of bullshit. 

<strong>Team Striegel vs Malik Turner’s Playoff Catch %</strong><br>
ROBINSON IS ACTIVE BENCH MOONEY IMMEDIETELY <br><br>
Ahem. Our completely unbiased experts predict this is finally the week where Striegel puts everything together and defeats Catch % in a shocking blowout upset, putting their playoff chances in peril. 

<strong>Best Loser vs Macho Mel</strong><br>
Both teams are at 3-4. Realistically, barring a miracle comeback whoever losses this match is out of the playoffs. Given DJ Moore’s awful game against the Falcons, Chris Carson being out, Mostert being out, and David Johnson being on bye, Macho Mel should easily win this one. <br><br>
Which means they won’t. Scotty Miller drops 30+ and leads Best Loser to victory. 

<strong>No Kap vs Team Hide and Zeke</strong><br>
This may be the matchup with the most playoff implications this week. The Winner of this match gets a critical tiebreaker, and No Kap is fighting to stay in control of the #4 seed. After Thursday’s game though, it seems neither team realizes how important this game is. Mike Davis put up another stinker and likely played his way out of a role once CMC comes back. Ridley got hurt early in the game and wasn’t able to contribute much. The running backs will be the deciding factors. Can Ezekiel Elliot stop being such a monumental disappointment? Will Dalvin Cook be at full strength? <br><br>
We’re giving the edge to No Kap.
