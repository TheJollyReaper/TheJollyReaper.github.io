      <description>Let the Floodgates OpenAnd let the trades rush forth. Early in the morning, in the dead dark of night, team Macho Mel swindled LeGarrette Cunt into giving away their best player for a pair of scrubs. Our insider sources have confirmed that Leonard Fournette and Julio Jones are now Melians, while the Browns (AJ and Marquise) have been sentenced to serve on LeGarrette Cunt. This is very questionable trade for LeGarrette Cunt.</description>

      <description>#12: The One Inch WonderThe One Inch Wonder was a catastrophic failure in their week one matchup against the Hobos. That shouldn’t come as a surprise, given the F grade they received on their draft. Where to even start with this team. To begin with, the Hobos two starting RUNNING BACKS had more receiving yards than Inch’s starting wide receivers. Kelce and Mahomey were good as expected, but everyone else was a complete disaster.</description>
